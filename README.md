A gesture detection library written in scala.

Ported from the Android module `android.gesture` for use outside of Android applications.

The main use case for this library is with libGdx. However does not require libGdx to run.

The TODO list is currently just porting everything in the java folder into scala.

## TODO
* ~~Gesture~~
* ~~GesturePoint~~
* ~~GestureStroke~~
* GestureStore
* GestureLibrary
* ~~Prediction~~
